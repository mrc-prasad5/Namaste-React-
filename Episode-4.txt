1. Name the app: Food Delivery

2. Important phase of developing an app is planning.

3. Should create a visual picture of the application.

4. Inline css styling in ReactJS can be done using JS Object
   
Eg: const styleCard = {
      backgroundColor:'#f0f0f0'
    }

    const RestoCard = () => {
        return (
            <div className='resto-card' style={styleCard}>
                <h3>Meghana Foods</h3>
            </div>
        )
   }

5. In react a concept called props alias properties called normal JS arguments.

6. Passing a prop to a functional component is nothing like passing arguments to a function.

7. Config Driven UI: Controlling UI using data from API. UI is driven by a config.
   Eg: Data can be different as per requirement but same UI, same application

8. Inorder to avoid re-rendering of data should use unique key attribute by passing unique value. React doesn`t recommend usage of index as keys.
